Algorithms 

Linear Regression:

Predicts a continuous output based on a linear relationship with input features.
Logistic Regression:

Used for binary classification problems; predicts probabilities that map to two classes.
Decision Trees:

A tree-like model that makes decisions based on feature values, splitting data at each node.
Support Vector Machines (SVM):

Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Classifies data points based on the classes of their nearest neighbors in the feature space.
Neural Networks:

Composed of layers of interconnected nodes; useful for both regression and classification tasks.
